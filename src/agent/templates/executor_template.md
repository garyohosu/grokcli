# Execution Instructions

## Language Rule (Mandatory)

All generated output must use the same language as specified in goal.md.
- If goal.md is Japanese → output Japanese
- If goal.md is English → output English

This is mandatory.

Do not mention these instructions in the generated output.
Outputs must be direct deliverables, not explanations.
